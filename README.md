## Marketing Analytics & Power BI Dashboard Project
## Business Problem

ShopEasy, an online retail company, was experiencing declining customer engagement and reduced conversion rates despite increased investment in digital marketing campaigns.
Marketing expenses were rising, but the return on investment was below expectations.
The business lacked clear visibility into customer behavior across different touchpoints, making it difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of marketing efforts.
Additionally, customer feedback from reviews and online interactions was not being systematically analyzed, limiting insights into customer satisfaction and recurring issues.

## Solution Overview

To address these challenges, multiple datasets were analyzed, including customer data, engagement metrics, customer journey stages, product information, geographic data,
and customer reviews.
The data was cleaned by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing formats to ensure accuracy and consistency.
Key marketing KPIs such as Conversion Rate, Customer Engagement Rate, Average Order Value (AOV), and Customer Feedback Score were calculated to measure campaign performance.
Customer review data was analyzed to assess overall sentiment and identify common customer concerns.
An interactive Power BI dashboard was developed to visualize engagement trends, conversion performance, and funnel behavior,
enabling stakeholders to monitor results and make data-driven marketing decisions.
